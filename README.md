Responsive Data Tables
======================

This is a shim to allow for Responsive Tables.

This plugin allows <table>'s to become responsive without much work. Most of it is JavaScript. There are no required styles for this particular plugin either.

To initialize this plugin, load the file and add classes to your tables that you'd like to be responsive:

```
<table class=".table">
```

Prerequisites
======================

This plugin requires jQuery.

This has been tested on Chrome, and IE.
